    <b>These Terms, specifically for Applicants, are in addition to the other generic Terms & Conditions listed on the page, which are common to all users of the site and must be reviewed by you. Violation of these T&Cs may lead to consequences, including but not limited to, the rejection of a job application and/or permanent account suspension, as well as potential legal action by SEPL.</b>
    <br/>
    <br/><p>
    1. If you've applied for a job on Job Plaza and receive communication from Job Plaza or an Employer regarding your application, you must respond within 72 hours.
    </p><p>
    2. Once you accept a job offer, you must make every effort to join and start the job on time. Failing to do so or declining a previously accepted job offer at the last moment creates a poor impression and may result in your account being blocked on Job Plaza, with reports made to your college administration as applicable.
    </p><p>
    3. Providing accurate and complete information when applying for a job or creating an account on Job Plaza is mandatory. Misrepresentation, hiding material information, or impersonation will result in your account being blocked on the site and reported to your college administration where applicable.
    </p><p>
    4. Please review a job's complete details (profile, location, remuneration, required skills, etc.) before applying. Irrelevant applications may lead to penalties, including restrictions on future job applications or account suspension.
    </p><p>
    5. Transferring, selling, or sharing Employers' data (contact details, etc.) with any other entity, whether for free or a fee, is strictly prohibited. Such actions will result in permanent account suspension on Job Plaza and may lead to legal action against you.
    </p><p>
    6. Maintain high standards of professionalism in your interactions with other users and Employers within the Job Plaza community. All communications, whether through Job Plaza Chat or other means, must be professional and free from obscene or offensive content.
    </p><p>
    7. You are required to review and understand the 'Safety Tips for Applicants' section of these Terms.
    </p><p>
    8. While we aim to provide accurate and reliable job information, errors can occur. Therefore, you must conduct your own due diligence and research about an employer or organization before accepting a job, taking full responsibility for your decisions. You also explicitly agree to the 'Disclaimers' section of these Terms.
    </p><p>
    9. If you encounter any suspicious activity, content, or behavior on Job Plaza by an Employer or another user, you must report it to Job Plaza immediately. This is your duty and obligation.
    </p><p>
    10. While we strive to offer the best job opportunities, Job Plaza does not guarantee a job to a student.
    </p><p>
    11. Upon registration, your registered email and phone number will automatically be subscribed to receive email, WhatsApp notifications, and SMS notifications from Job Plaza. You may opt out at any time.
    </p><p>
    12. Job Plaza reserves the right to remove your photo if it does not feature your likeness or a headshot photograph. If we remove your photo, you can upload a new one.
    </p><p>
    13. By uploading your profile picture, you authorize Job Plaza to share it with employers and other relevant users of the Job Plaza platform.
